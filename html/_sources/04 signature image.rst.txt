Go to Tab1, change "Patient" name to, for example, "header and footer template" and "Get signature".

Now in Tab3 you have two diferent templates "header and footer template" and "header image template".

"Get Signature" in Tab1 allows you to select an image from any folder.
An windows opens for image selection.

You can use your own image with the same size. Scan or photograph your sgnature and edit size in a free image editor.

Select image, close window, come back to Tab1, click on "Save changes before closing".

Click on "Create and Save Report to PDF" to save pdf and see the
result.


Now this report has a header and footer image.

The result  pdf is:

To remove image from footer you can change to a blank image (there is one  in install folder -->signature_blank.png) or
use  the previous template, in our case "header image template" (without image),
or you can go to  Tab 3 and  "Delete Signature".
