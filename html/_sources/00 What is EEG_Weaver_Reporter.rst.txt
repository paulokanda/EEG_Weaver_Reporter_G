EWR is a app tto create a EEG report, print it to pdf and store it in a dababank.
This report can be reprinted and/or used as a template to be modified to create a new report.
It is something that I needed and now I'm sharing with you.

I don't need it because I have microsoft Word and Libre office.

Ok. I have both, either. EWR is not a complete, amazing, text  editor.
On the contrary, we keep things ease, just to format a pdf report to print.
The main idea is to create databanks to store your reports in one place.

By the way changing some configurations  you can store any type of report.

Try EWR if you wish. I hope you enjoy it as I do.
