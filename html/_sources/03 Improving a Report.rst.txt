Improve report formatting - Insert a Header Image
-------------------------------------------------

Inserting a header image.

on Tab3, select a report, in our example "second template" which doesnot  have a header image.

.. image:: 00tab3.png

Go to Tab1, change "Patient" name to, for example, "header image template" and "Get Logo".

.. image:: 01tab3.png

Now in Tab3 you have two templates "second template" and "Header image template".

"Get Logo" in Tab1 allows you to select an image from any folder.
An windows opens for image selection.

The size of the image in pixes is shown bellow.

.. image:: 14tab1.png

You can use your own image with the same size.

Select image, close window, come back to Tab1, click on "Save changes before closing".

Click on "Create and Save Report to PDF" to save pdf and see the
result.

Now this report has a header image.

The result  pdf is:

.. image:: 16tab1.png

To remove image from header you can change to a blank image (there is one  in install folder --> blank_header.png) or
use  the previous template, in our case "second template" (without image),
or you can go to  Tab 3 and  "Delete Logo".
